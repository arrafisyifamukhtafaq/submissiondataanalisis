2. Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but in here I will use Google Colab).
3. Create a New Notebook.
4. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
5. upload csv file to google colab directory
6. Connect to hosted runtime.
7. Lastly, run the code cells.

### `dashboard/dashboard.py`
1. Download this project.
2. Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using `pip install streamlit`. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it `streamlit run dashboard.py`.
